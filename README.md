# E-cigarette Usage in the U.S.

Overview
E-cigarettes and other vaping products have quickly gained popularity in the United States. The advertisement of these devices as a cessation tool has contributed to the rise of e-cigarette use. Yet, there is question about whether they are merely another source of nicotine addiction. Recently, concerns over the devices have health experts and policymakers investigating hundreds of reported cases of vaping-related lung illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning against the use of e-cigarettes after multiple cases of deaths caused by vaping-related lung illnesses. The Behavorial Risk Factor Surveillance System has regularly tracked data for tobacco usage, including e-cigarette usgae, at the state and national levels. The purpose of this project is to display data for each state's e-cigarette usage in a map from 2016-2017 in addition to overall tobacco usage from 2011-2017.

Functionality
* Map represents each state and overall tobacco usage via color gradient. Legend serves as a scale.
* Users can hover over a state and have color of selected state in map change.
* Map displays data from 2011- 2017, controlled by a scroll bar.
* On hover, users will see a pop-up that displays data for overall tobacco usage. If year is 2016 or 2017, e-cigarette usage will also be displayed.

Technologies
* Javascript
* D3
* CSS/HTML
* Data from CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Data: Tobacco Use

MVPs
* User interface with map and year scrollbar
* Table visualizaton of data 
* Displaying of e-cigarette use on available years (2016-2017)

Timeline
Day 1: Setup webpack. Have an outline of how to approach each MVP item. Create a skeleton for the project. Familiarize myself with D3. Use CDC's API to extract specific data.

Day 2: Have map display data when hovering over specific state. Create a table to display data. 

Day 3: Finish map display, including scrollbar. Add finishing touches to map or table.

Day 4: Have map and table completed along with functional scrollbar. Work on CSS.

Weekend: Finish any incomplete features and fix any existing bugs.
