# E-cigarette Usage in the U.S.

## Overview

E-cigarettes and other vaping products have quickly gained popularity in the United States. The advertisement of these devices as a cessation tool has contributed to the rise of e-cigarette use. Yet, there is question about whether they are merely another source of nicotine addiction. Recently, concerns over the devices have health experts and policymakers investigating hundreds of reported cases of vaping-related lung illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning against the use of e-cigarettes after multiple cases of deaths caused by vaping-related lung illnesses. The Behavorial Risk Factor Surveillance System has regularly tracked data for tobacco usage, including e-cigarette usgae, at the state and national levels. The purpose of this project is to display data for each state's e-cigarette usage in a map from 2016-2017 in addition to e-cigarette usage in the youth population in 2016 via a bar graph.
